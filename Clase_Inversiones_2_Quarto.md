Summary: Return from Activos

Some assets provide: only income Bank savings account only appreciation in value Collectibles Gold both income & appreciation Stocks Rental housing

Tasa de Retorno Examples

Example 1 facts: Market value at begin of year: $2,000,000 Market value at end of year: $2,050,000 Ingresos generated this year: $200,000 Dollar Return? income + appreciation = 200,000 + 50,000 = $250,000 Tasa de Retorno?

Tasa de Retorno Examples

Example 2 facts: You purchased a one-once bar of gold for $1,500 a year ago and it is now valued at $1,600. Dollar Return? income + appreciation = 0 + $100 = $100 Tasa de Retorno?

---

Tasa de Retorno Examples

Example 3 facts: 10 shares of stock, with P/share = $80 a year ago, a current P = $85/share, & paid a dividend of $3/share. Dollar Return? income + appreciation = $3(10) + $5(10) = $80 Tasa de Retorno?

---

Tasa de Retorno Examples

Example 4 facts: A bond with a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 10% was purchased a year ago for $950 and is currently selling for $880. Return? income + appreciation = $100 – 70 = $30 Tasa de Retorno?

---

Tasa de Retorno Examples

Example 5 facts: You placed $1,000,000 under your mattress a year ago. Return? income + appreciation = 0 Really, no change in wealth over the year? It depends: If no change in prices of goods & services, then no change. But, if price of goods & services rises (i.e., inflation) then purchasing power has fallen

---

Real vs. Nominal

Nominal: growth rate of money Real: growth rate of actual purchasing power Inflation-adjusted rate of return

---

“Fisher Equation” (Irving Fisher)

Define: i = nominal interest rate p = inflation r = real rate of return (inflation-adjusted rate) Then, Fisher equation: i = r + p or r = i - p

---

Example: Calculate Real Tasa de Retorno on Long-term U.S. Treasury Bonds

Suppose Nominal rate of return (i): 5.4% (bonds) Inflation (p): 3.0%

Fisher equation (approximation): r = i - p = 5.4% - 3.0% = 2.4%

---

Real Tasa de Retorno in Previous Examples

Suppose the inflation rate was 7.0%: Example: Nominal – Inflation = Real 1 12.5 7.0 5.5 2 6.7 7.0 -0.3 3 10.0 7.0 3.0 4 3.2 7.0 -3.8 5 0 7.0 -7.0 In order to increase your wealth, you must have real rate of return > 0.

---

The Real World …

Rates of return vary from year to year For example, Change in stock price Change in dividend Usually do not know the future rate of return, but only have an: Expected rate of return

---

Expected Tasa de Retorno

Weighted average of all the possible actual rates of return Where each possibility is weighted by its likelihood of happening = probability Activity

---

Expected Tasa de Retorno Activity

Break into \_\_\_\_ groups of \_\_\_\_ participants each Distribute one bag to each group. Each group will randomly (without looking into the bag) draw a single piece of paper from the bag each round If a green item is drawn: record 4% If an orange item is drawn: record 8% If a blue item is drawn: record 12% Take turns drawing from the bag. Record the result each round. Compute average return by adding 10 rates, then divide by 10.

---

Results

Each group average? Near 9% Average of all groups? Even closer to 9% Why? This is the expected rate of return Or the average rate of return a person could expect each period from the investment over many periods.

---

Expected Tasa de Retorno Calculation

Possible Outcomes Chance of Happening (probability) 4 1 out of 4 = 0.25 8 1 out of 4 = 0.25 12 2 out of 4 = 0.50 Expected return: = (0.25 x 4) + (0.25 x 8) + (0.50 x 12) = 9
